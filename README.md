credit.c  ->  takes a credit card number as input and shows if it is valid or not...it is an early prototype...the more accurate one is the credit.cpp...
credit.cpp  ->  concept similar to credit.cpp...just some added constraints and logic...

encryptText.c  ->  it was part of a cs50 assignment...takes a text and encrypts it using a key that is entered by the user...
